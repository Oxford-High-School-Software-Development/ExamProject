                    <p>
                        <i>YOUR WORLD IS THE SETTING FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN</i>, the place where adventures happen.
                        Even if you use an existing setting, such as the Forgotten Realms, it becomes yours as you set your adevntures there, create characters to inhabit it, and make changes to it over the course of your campaign.
                        This chapter is all labout building your world and then creating a campaign to take place in it.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
                        <p>
                            This book, the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> and the <i>Monster Manual</i> present the default assumptions for how the worlds of D&D work.
                            Among the established settings of D&D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Mystara don't stray very far from those assumptions.
                            Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further away from that baseline.
                            As you create your own world, it's up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want your world to fall.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Core Assumptions</h3>
                            <p>
                                The rules of the game are based on the following core assumptions about the game world.
                                <br>
                                <b>Gods Oversee the World.</b>
                                The gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, forests, or the sea.
                                Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their followers and sending signs and portents to guide them.
                                The follwer of a god serves as an agent of that god in the world.
                                The agent seeks to futher the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals.
                                While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, none can deny their existence.
                                <br>
                                <b>Much of the world is Untamed.</b>
                                Wild regions abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms of various sizes dot the landscape, but beyond their borders the wilds crowd in.
                                People know the area they live in well.
                                They've heard stories of other places from merchants and travelers but few know what lies beyond the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless they've been there themselves.
                                <br>
                                <b>The World is Ancient.</b>
                                Empires rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by imperial gandeur or decay.
                                War, time, and natural forces eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and mystery.
                                Ancient civilizations and their knowledge survive in legends, magic items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an empire's collapse.
                                <br>
                                <b>Conflict Shapes the World's History.</b>
                                Powerful individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course of history.
                                Factions include religions led by charismatic prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic.
                                The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as they compete with each other for power.
                                Some seek to preserve the world and usher in a golden age.
                                Others strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with an iron fist.
                                Still others seek golds that range from the pratical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god.
                                Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, creating conflic that can steer the world's fate.
                                <br>
                                <b>The World is Magical.</b>
                                Practitioners of magic are relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of their craft everywhere.
                                The magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as a portion that heals wounds to something much more rare and impressive, such as a levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates of a city.
                                Beyond the realms of civilization are caches of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters cretaed by magic, cursed by magic or endowned with magical abilities.

                            <h3>It's Your World</h3>
                            <p>
                                In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with the core assumptions and consider how your setting might change them.
                                The subsequent sections of this chapter address each element and give details on how to flesh out your world with gods factions, and so forth.
                                The assumptions sketched out above aren't cared in stone. They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of adventure, but they're not the only set of assumptions that can do so.
                                They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of adventure, but they're not the only set of assumptions that can do so.
                                You can build an interesting campaign concept by altering one or more of those core assumptions, just as well-established D&D worlds have done.
                                Ask yourself, "What if the standard assumptions weren't true in m world?"
                                <br>
                                <b>The World is a Mundane Place.</b>
                                What if magic is rare and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no access to it?
                                What if your campaign is set in a version of our own world's history?
                                <br>
                                <b>The World Is New.</b>
                                What if your world is new, and the characters are the first of a long line of heroes?
                                The adventurers might be champions of the first greate empires, such as the empires of Netheril and Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting.
                                <br>
                                <b>The World is Known.</b>
                                What if the world is completly charted and mapped, right down to the "here there be dragons" notations?
                                What if great empires cover huge stretches of countryside, withclearly defined borders between them?
                                The Five Nations of the Eberron setting were once part of a great empire, and magically aided travel between its cities is commonplace.
                                <br>
                                <b>Monsters Are Uncommon.</b>
                                What if monsters are rare and terrifying?
                                In the Ravenloft setting, horrific domains are governed by monstrous rulers.
                                The populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble people's daily lives.
                                <br>
                                <b>Magic Is Everywhere.</b>
                                What if every town is ruled by a powerful wizard?
                                What if magic item shops are common?
                                The Eberron setting makes the use of magic an everyday occurrence, as magical flying ships and trains carry travelers from one great city to another.
                                <br>
                                <b>Gods Inhabit the Land, or are Entirely Absent.</b>
                                What if the gods regularly walk the earth?
                                What if the characters can challgnge them and seize their power?
                                Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never make contact with mortals?
                                In the Dark Sun setting, the gods are extremely distant--perhaps nonexistent--and clerics rely instead on elemental power for their magic.

                            Appendix B of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> presents a number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your game, including the gods of established D&D worlds and fantasy-historical pantheons.
