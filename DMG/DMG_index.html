                    This book has two important companions: the Player's Handbook, which contains the rules your players need to create chracters and the rules you need to run the game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to-use monsters to populate your D&D world.

                <h2>The Dungeon Master</h2>
                <p>
                    The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for the other players to explore, and also crates and runs adventures that drive the story.
                    An adventure typically hinges on the sucessful completion of a quest, and can be as short as a single game session.
                    Longer adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that require multiple game sessions to resolve.
                    When strung together, these adventures form an ongoing campaign.
                    A D&D campaign can include dozens of adventures and last for months or years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats.
                    As the architect of a campaign, the DM creates adventures by placing monsters, traps and treasures for the other a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize what's happening around them, improvising when the adventureers do something or go somewhere unexpected.
                    As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and supporting characters, breathing life into them.
                    And as a referee, the DM interprets therules and decides when to abide by them and when to change them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting, refereeing -- every DM handles these roles differently, and you'll probably enjoy some more than others.
                    It helps to remember that Dungeons & Dragons is a hobby, and being the DM should be fun.
                    Focus on the aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest.
                    For example, if you don't like crating your own adventures, you can use published ones.
                    You can also lean on the other players to help you with rules mastery and world-building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The D&D rules help you and the other players have a good time, but the rules help you and the other players hav a good time, but the rules aren't in charge.
                    You're the DM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your goal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a campaign world that revolves around their actions and decisions, and to keep your players coming back for more!
                    If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will echo in the memories of your players long after the final game session ic concluded.

                <h2>How To Use This Book</h2>
                <p>
                    This book is organized in three parts.
                    The first part helps you decide what kind of campaign you'd like to run.
                    The second part helps you create the adventures (the stories) that will compose the campaign and keep the players entertained from one game session to the next.
                    The last part helps you adjudicate the rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of your campaign.
                </p>

                <div>
                <h3><a href="DMG_Parts/DMG_Part1.html">Part 1: Master of Worlds</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign world.
                    Whether you invent a world, adapt a world form a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for the D&D game, you make that world your own over the course of a campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The world where you set your campaign is on eof countless worlds that muake up the D&D multiverse, a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures happen.
                    Even if you're using an established world such as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital games are assumed to take place.
                    The world is your to change as you see fit and your to midfy as you explore change as you see fit and yours to modify as you explore the consequences of the players' actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your world is more than just a backdrop for adventures. Like Middle Earth, westeros, and countless other fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold.
                    A well-designed and well-run world seems to flow around the adventurers, so that they feel part of something, instead of apart from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consistency is a key to a believable fictional world.
                    When the adventurers go back into town for supplies, they should encounter the same <b>nonplayer characters</b>(NPCs) they met before.
                    Soon, they'll learn the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember theirs as well.
                    Once you have achieved this degree of consistency, you can provide an occasional change.
                    If they adventurers come back to buy more horses at the stables, they might discover that the man who ran the place went back home to the large city over the hills, and now his niece runs the family business.
                    That sort of change (one that has nothing to do with the adventurers directly, but one that they'll notice) makes the player feel as though their characters are part of a living world that changes and grows along with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part 1 of this book is all about inventing your world.
                    Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want to run, and helps you nail down a few important details about your world and it's overarching conflicts.
                    Chapter 2 helps you put your world in the greater context of the multiverse, expanding on the information presented in the <i><a href="../PH_index.html">Player's Handbook</a></i> to discuss the planes of existence and the gods and how you can put them together to serve the needs of your campaign.

                <p>
                    Whether you write your own adventures or use published ones, expect to invest preparation time beyond the hours you spend at the gameing table.
                    You'll need to carve out some free time to exercise your creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new NPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to foreshadow story events yet to come.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create and run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic elements of a D&D adventure, and chapter 4 helps you create memorable NPCs.
                    Chapter 5 presents guidelines and advice for running adventures set in dungeons, the wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers the time between adventures.
                    Chapter 7 is all about reasure, magic items, and special rewards that help keep the players invested in your campaign.
