                <p>The <b class="">D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s r o l e p l a y in g</b>
            game is about storytelling in w orlds of
            sw ords and sorcery. It shares elements
            with childhood gam es of make-believe. Like
            those games, D & D is driven by im agination. It’s about picturing the towering castle
            beneath the stormy night sky and imagining
            how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges
            that scene presents.
                </p>
                <p>Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure
            to the stories, a way of determining the consequences
            of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve
            whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a
            magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous
            task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p>
                <p>In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player creates and adventuer(also caleed a character) and teams up with other adventurers(played by friends). 
            Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, 
            or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventuers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items 
            and other treasure.
                </p>
                <p>One player however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master(DM), the game's lead storyteller and referee.
            The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft,
            and the players decide what they wnat their adventuers to do.
            Will they walk across the dnagerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will if the drawbridge gives way?
            Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?
